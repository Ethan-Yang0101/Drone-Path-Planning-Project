\section {Software Architecture Description}
\subsection {Introduction to the Autonomous Drone Program}
This section will provide overview of the autonomous drone program. The autonomous drone program is developed to collect readings from air quality sensors distributed around the University of Edinburghâ€™s Central Area. Drone flies around, avoids no fly zones and collects the sensor readings and produces scientific visualisations of the data in the form of GeoJSON file and produces a txt file which records flight information of drone.

\subsection {Architectural Overview of the Program}
This section will provide a comprehensive architectural overview by UML class diagram and briefly explain the purpose of each class designed and why these classes are the right ones for program. In addition, there are some explanations of advantages of this architectural design. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{UML.png}\\
\caption{Figure 1: UML Class Diagram of Program's Architecture}
\end{center}

\textbf{Class App} which is located at the top of the UML class diagram is the most significant class which contains the main method to run the program. This class only contains main method which integrates methods from Class Drone to write GeoJSON file and txt file.

\textbf{Class Drone} which is located in the middle is the biggest class and contains the most important algorithm to let drone fly around, avoid no fly zones and collect reading from sensors. This class focus on implementing drone control algorithm which is built by lots of components (small methods) and connect DataServer and GeoJsonServer which will be explained later to get data support and update sensor information to GeoJsonServer. It also write a flight path file after process of collection. This design makes Class Drone focus on single part of task without considering how to request data from web server and write GeoJSON file. 

\textbf{Class DataServer} which is located at the bottom contains all methods that get data from web server. This class only focus on parsing JSON data from web server and processing data to data structures that Class Drone need. This class also help GeoJsonServer to update information. 

\textbf{Class GeoJsonServer} which is located at the upper right focus on setting up initial state of GeoJSON map and updating information when drone receives sensor data. This class can write a GeoJSON file by using its field which stores sensors' information. 

\textbf{All these three classes are highly independent and focus on single part of tasks.} Such design has great advantages in program maintenance. If DataServer fails due to change or error occurs in web server will not affect primary design of methods in other class. Changing the format of GeoJSON file will not affect any methods designed in other class. The error that drone fails to autonomously fly around only caused by some of components of Class Drone.

\textbf{Class FlightDetail} which is located at the upper left stores all the data needed to write flight path file. Each FlightDetail object stores one row of information in flight path file which contains step number, longitude and latitude of current and next position, direction of move in degree and location of sensor detected.

\textbf{Class SensorDetail, LocationDetail and Coordinates} are used to store the data parsed from JSON file in web server. They provide common objects for three classes introduced in the last few paragraphs to store some information about sensors' data and sensors' location.

\textbf{Classes in last 2 paragraphs are just data classes.} They are designed based on format of JSON file except FlightDetail class which is designed to separate writing function from drone control algorithm. This class benefits software testing because it does not need to write txt files every time when algorithm runs in the program.

\textbf{There are some advantages of this architectural design.} Small methods divide drone control algorithm into many single functions which are easy to maintain and find bugs when program has error. Besides the refactor of program, loosely coupled design in this architecture is really important for maintenance since the web server and output requirement change over time. There is no static field which is dangerous when share address in different objects.

\section {Drone Control Algorithm}
\subsection {Introduction to the Algorithm}

This section will introduce the whole drone flight process in detail. And in next few sections, there are comprehensive explanations of essential algorithms used during process. The general idea of drone control algorithm is really simple. Drone firstly makes a plan to decide what order of sensors that it will go to collect data and then follows the plan and flies directly towards those sensors one by one until all the sensors' data have been collected and finally return to the start position. During the process, it will avoid all the no fly zones between one sensor and another sensor, so it will change the direction of move if next move of drone will hit the no fly zones. This general process has been shown in the figure below which is produced by geojson.io:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.83\textwidth]{2020-08-08.png}\\
\caption{Figure 2: A sample output map for the date 08/08/2020.}
\end{center}
From figure above, we can see that the drone starts at central area of the university and go to each sensors step by step, while avoiding no fly zones. It is clear to see that drone cross narrow street between Informatics Forum and Appleton Tower which are two no fly zones commonly between one sensor and another sensor. Drone collects sensor's data within 0.0002 degree of sensor so some parts of path are not close enough to sensors. Overall, the drone use a reasonably good strategy to plan the order of sensors so that the flight path is really efficient.

\subsection {No-fly Zone Avoidance Algorithm}
This section will explain no-fly zone avoidance algorithm which play a significant role in the drone control algorithm. The figure in last section has shown how this algorithm avoids no fly zones and in this section, it will be explained in detail. This algorithm has been implemented in \textbf{cross\_no\_fly\_zone}, \textbf{boundary\_avoid\_degree} and \textbf{move\_one\_step} methods in \textbf{Class Drone}. The general idea of algorithm is that if the flight path between current position and next position of drone in one move intersects with any boundaries of no fly zones, the drone can be considered as 'hit the no fly zones'. 

When drone hits the no fly zones, the drone has three different strategies to solve the problem. The choice of strategies is based on 'mode' parameter. There are three values for 'mode' parameter - 'clockwise', 'anticlockwise' and 'double'. 'clockwise' is a strategy that turns the degree of move which towards target sensor in clockwise direction until next position will not hit the no fly zones. In similar way, 'anticlockwise' is a strategy in the same way but turns degree in anticlockwise direction. 'double' is more smart than those two and will determine which direction will turn less degree to avoid hitting no fly zones. The drone uses those three strategies and a consistent rule that in every steps, drone will towards the target sensor that it want to collect data. This makes flight path of drone similar to fly along the edge of no fly zones which is shown in figure 2. This algorithm still make sure that if drone does not hit no fly zones, it will move towards target sensor directly. 

If you think about algorithm rigorously, you will find bugs in these strategies. For examples, if the edge of no fly zones is too long, the 'double' will fail by moving left and right repeatedly and finally get stuck. There is a solution given in this algorithm. If next position of drone is where has been reached in the past, the drone will change the degree to opposite direction of that degree and find an appropriate degree which will not hit no fly zones. This helps 'double' get out of local trap. Overall, this algorithm is really robust to avoid no fly zones although sometimes drone will move strangely when it meets groove. 

\subsection {Swap Greedy Path Planning Algorithm}

This section will explain swap greedy path planning algorithm which helps drone to make a wise choice to plan the order of sensors. This algorithm is implemented in two methods \textbf{find\_nearest\_sensor} and \textbf{swap\_greedy\_flight\_planning} in \textbf{Class Drone}. In figure 3, we can see that most of time the drone will choose the closest sensor to visit and this process will repeat over and over again until all the sensors has been visited. This is the idea of greedy part of algorithm. However, greedy algorithm has a limitation that it is easy to get local optimal results rather than global optimal result. The pure greedy algorithm sometimes can not get efficient plan since plan is based on straight line approximation without considering the real situation such as avoiding no fly zones. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.83\textwidth]{2020-01-01.png}\\
\caption{Figure 3: A sample output map for the date 01/01/2020.}
\end{center}
There is an improvement for greedy algorithm called swap heuristic. The general idea of swap heuristic is that swapping two sensors in a list when total distance of sensors decreases after swapping. This process will repeat until all possible swaps in this list has been tried. This is swap part of algorithm. There is also a heuristic part. If swap occurs in the whole tries, the whole tries will start again until there is no any swap occurs in the whole tries. Swap greedy path planning algorithm combines both greedy algorithm and swap heuristic. The algorithm will firstly use greedy to get a intuitively good plan and then use swap heuristic to help greedy get out of local optimal. Swap greedy algorithm always give a circular path which hardly ever has intersecting lines in flight path. This has been shown in upper right of figure 3 where drone decides to go to a furthest sensor below rather than nearest red sensor and then visits a list of sensors which are close to each other from below to above. Swap Heuristic unties the intersecting lines made by greedy and shorten the path.

\subsection {Path Re-Planning Algorithm}
This section will explain path re-planning algorithm which is hardly ever used in drone control algorithm but plays a significant role when it is necessary. This algorithm is implemented in \textbf{first\_sensor\_planning} and \textbf{drone\_control\_algorithm} in \textbf{Class Drone}. If you think about the algorithms shown in last few sections, there is a risk that drone possibly flight around in a groove and wast a lot of steps to get out of groove and finally cannot finish collection within 150 steps. And in extreme situation, it is possible that drone still get stuck in local trap. Although those situation is rare, algorithm failure still need to be considered.

One way to solve this problem is re-planning the flight path which changes the first sensor planned by swap greedy path planning algorithm. Greedy algorithm is sensitive to choice of first sensor due to its local optimal drawback. This drawback can be used as a way to re-plan the flight path by trying different sensors as first sensor. The order to try different sensors should be intuitive. So algorithm sorts all sensors by distance between sensors and drone start position from closest to furthest and use this order to try re-planning. This algorithm has a parameter 'tolerant' which can be set to any integer value between 1 and 33. This parameter can decides how many algorithm failure can be tolerated. Over this value, the algorithm will stop regardless it success or not. This parameter design is due to Java memory limit and thread limit.

\subsection{Path Minimization Algorithm}
This section will explain last algorithm in drone control algorithm which is implemented in \textbf{main method} of \textbf{Class App}. This algorithm uses three different modes introduced in no fly zones avoidance algorithm and get three different results. After that choosing one which has minimum steps among three modes and writing flight path file and GeoJSON file based on it. This algorithm helps drone to choose a more efficient flight path and largely decrease the risk of algorithm failure.
